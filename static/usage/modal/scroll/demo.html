      <p>It is not a disaster. It's not a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living
        soul. You wanna know why? One word: blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster - for her. That DEA
        brother-in-law? Screwed! You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the
        hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil! 'My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!' And the house?
        Gone! The feds will come in and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that,
        noooo. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing. And she knows it.</p>
      <p>Today's your lucky day. Look around, kiddo - it's all yours. You are now the owner of this fine establishment.
        Free? Oh ladies, cover your ears. No... not free. Look, hey... this is a squeaky clean, highly profitable (at
        least potentially), local institution. Look the bottom with favor by the chamber of commerce, better business
        bureau at three-hundred and twelve thousand dollars, it's a steal.</p>
      <p>Don't you get it? On the outside it's a nail salon right, on the inside it's the best money laundering a
        growing boy could ask for. Wait, wait! Come back here. Sit. Come on, come on... humor me here for a second. You
        know you need to launder your money, right? Do you understand the basics of it - placement, layering,
        integration. Well, you wanna stay out of jail don't ya? You wanna keep your money and your freedom. Cause I got
        three little letters for ya, I - R - S. If they can get Capone, they can get you.</p>
      <p>What am I eighth grade hall monitor? Current whereabouts? Let me tell you something, Mike. There are rules to
        this lawyer thing. Attorney client privilege, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you! If I give up
        Pinkman, then you're gonna be asking, old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy what's to keep him from giving me up?
        You see, so then, where's the trust?</p>
      <p>Look, let's start with some tough love, alright? Ready for this? Here it goes: you two suck at peddling meth.
        Period. Good! 'Oh boo-hoo, I won't cook meth anymore!' You're a crybaby! Who needs you?! Hey, I'm unplugging the
        website, so no more money laundering! How do you like that?!</p>
